Developed an advanced Remaining Useful Life (RUL) prediction model on NASAâ€™s turbofan engine degradation dataset using LSTM.
Performed full preprocessing pipeline including normalization, interpolation for short sequences, and handcrafted feature fusion using
regression coefficients.
Integrated a custom 3D attention mechanism around LSTM layers with engineered sensor-level statistics to improve temporal feature
extraction.
Trained the model with dropout, early stopping, and custom callbacks; achieved RMSE as low as 25.9 across multiple runs.
Exported predicted results as .mat and .csv for cross-platform evaluation; visualized test loss, RMSE trend, and prediction curves over test
units.
